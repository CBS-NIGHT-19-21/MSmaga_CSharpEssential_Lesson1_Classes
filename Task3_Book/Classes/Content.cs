// !!!Realize the Object-oriented programming principle - Encapsulation (hiding the implementation).
// Encapsulate data set and methods for working on it as an object.
// Declarate class of this kind of objects.
// Declarate the method to constructor an object of this class.

// !!!Implement a way to organize interaction between classes - Composition : Association.
// Declarate class of this kind of objects as a mandatory member - a field of another class.

// Declaration of the Methods-fields to access to fields of the object.
// This is contrary to encapsulation!!!
